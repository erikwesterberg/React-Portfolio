# React-Portfolio - BY Erik Westerberg

We are using:

NPM as package manager that helps us to install or update third-party packages and dependencies.

Webpack as bundler that lets us to write modular code and bundle it together into small packages to optimize load time.

Babel as compiler that lets us write ES6 code and make sure our code works in older browsers.

We have made significant progress but have only scratched the surface yet.
