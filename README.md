# React-Portfolio - BY Erik Westerberg

We are using:

NPM as package manager that helps us to install or update third-party packages and dependencies.

Webpack as bundler that lets us to write modular code and bundle it together into small packages to optimize load time.

Babel as compiler that lets us write ES6 code and make sure our code works in older browsers.

We have made significant progress but have only scratched the surface yet.

 Everything in react is a component. And components return exactly 1 dom element.
 everything inside of curly brackets will execude like normal JS.

Must call super on the first line in React when u use a constructor

If u gonna create a header or whatever you create a own component.

Render Props. The term “render prop” refers to a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function. A component with a render prop takes a function that returns a React element and calls it instead of implementing its own render logic.
